        <h4>Recipe instructions</h4>

        <ol> 
            <li>Finely dice the onion, slice/shred the Brussels sprouts and cut the bacon into thin slices.</li>
            <li>Warm the butter in a small (8in/20cm) nonstick skillet/frying pan over a medium-high heat and add the onion and bacon. Cook for a few minutes until the onion softens and the bacon starts to brown.</li>
            <li>Add the shredded Brussels sprouts and cook for a few minutes until they start to brown.</li>
            <li>Mix in the mashed potatoes so they are evenly distributed then flatten the mixture in the skillet.</li>
            <li>Leave the mixture to cook a few minutes (around 5) so that the bottom browns slightly.</li>
            <li>Place a plate over the skillet and flip it over so the mixture falls onto the plate. Add a little bit more butter, if needed, to the skillet, then slide the mixture back into the skillet with what was the top on the bottom. Cook another few minutes until browned on the other side.</li>
            <li>Turn the bubble and squeak onto a plate. If you want to serve it with a fried egg, you can just fry it in the same skillet.</li>
        </ol>
