          <h4>Recipe instructions</h4>

          <ol>
                <li>Fill a large pot or deep fryer with 2-3 inches of oil and bring to 350 F. While the oil is heating, whisk two eggs in a bowl. Fill a separate pot with water and bring to a boil. Boil the remaining eggs for 5-7 minutes, for a soft center, 8-10 minutes for a hard center. Remove from the boiling water and place in an ice bath.<li>
                  Use a stand mixer to mix together the sausage, half of the bread crumbs and the nutmeg, parsley, and dry mustard. Divide the meat into four even sized portions.
                <li>Carefully peel the eggs. Take one portion of the sausage mixture and flatten into a thin patty. Place the peeled egg in the center and wrap the meat around the egg so that it is encased in the middle. Repeat with the remaining eggs and meat.</li>
                <li>Put the flour in one bowl and the breadcrumbs in another. Season with salt and pepper. Roll the sausage in flour so it is completely covered, then roll in the whisked eggs, and finally place into a bowl filled with bread crumbs so it is coated in crumbs.</li>
                <li>Transfer the eggs to the hot oil. Fry for 8-15 minutes, or until the sausage is dark brown and cooked through. Use a slotted spoon to remove the Scotch eggs from the oil and place on a paper towel lined plate. Let cool for five minutes.</li>
                <li>In a small bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, yellow mustard, curry powder and whole grain mustard. Serve alongside a hot Scotch egg.</li>
