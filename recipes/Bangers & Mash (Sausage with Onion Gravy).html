    <p>Sausage with Onion Gravy and Mashed Potato – affectionately known as “Bangers and Mash” – is one of the greatest of all comfort foods. A sausage recipe for a quick easy dinner with a side of peas or steamed vegetables to douse in the homemade gravy.</p>
    <p>The onion gravy is to-die for but only requires 4 things: onion, garlic, beef broth/stock and flour. That’s it!.</p>

        <h4>Recipe instructions</h4>

        <ol>
          <li>Heat oil in a large skillet / fry pan
            over medium high heat. Add
            sausages and cook, turning, unti
            browned as much as possible all over and cooked through. Cook
            time will differ depending on
            sausage size</li>
          <li>Remove sausages onto a plate</li>
          <li>Turn heat down to medium
              You need around 2 tbsp oil left in the skillet. If you have much less, add a bit of butter or oil</li>
          <li>Add onion and garlic, cook until golden brown - around 4 minutes</li>
          <li>Add flour and mix through</li>
          <li>Add about 3/4 cup of beef broth and mix into the onion so it becomes a
            sludge. Then add remaining beef broth and mix until combined.</li>
          <li>Simmer, stirring, until the gravy thickens but is slightly thinner than you want -
            it will thicken more as you serve it. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
          <li>Serve sausages with gravy, with mashed potato and peas on the side</li>
